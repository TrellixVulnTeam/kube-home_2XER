# kube-home
Very basic home install of Kubernetes

This repo is home to services that I run on my Kubernetes cluster running in my livingroom. By no means is this polished, production-worthy work, but sufficent for maintaining with miminal effort. This repo exists as a point of reference and disaster recovery in case the server is lost.
