  # This will set ${MQTT_PASSWORD} to the 'password' key from the 'mqtt' secret

# Enable pod security context (must be `true` if runAsUser or fsGroup are set)

# Set runAsUser to 1000 to let home-assistant run as non-root user 'hass' which exists in 'runningman84/alpine-homeassistant' docker image.
# When setting runAsUser to a different value than 0 also set fsGroup to the same value:
# runAsUser: <defaults to 0>
# fsGroup: <will be omitted in deployment if runAsUser is 0>

resources:
  # We usually recommend not to specify default resources and to leave this as a conscious
  # choice for the user. This also increases chances charts run on environments with little
  # resources, such as Minikube. If you do want to specify resources, uncomment the following
  # lines, adjust them as necessary, and remove the curly braces after 'resources:'.
  # limits:
  #  cpu: 100m
  #  memory: 128Mi
  requests:
   cpu: 10m
