# Docker
These repos are for custom docker images in order to get services to work in `kube-home`. Some of them may just have tweaks to get better performance.

## Execute
Change directory into the desired docker folder and run the following:

```
./build.sh <tag>
```

_Where `tag` is an identifier used for the docker tag_
